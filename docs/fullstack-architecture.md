# Full-Stack Application Architecture

This document outlines the architectural design for the full-stack application, covering its various components, their interactions, and the underlying technologies.

## 1. High-Level Architecture

(Diagram or description of the main components and their relationships)

## 2. Frontend Architecture

### 2.1. Technology Stack
- Framework/Library: [e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js]
- Language: [e.g., TypeScript, JavaScript]
- State Management: [e.g., Redux, Zustand, Vuex, NGRX]
- Styling: [e.g., CSS Modules, Styled Components, Tailwind CSS]
- Build Tool: [e.g., Webpack, Vite, Parcel]

### 2.2. Component Structure
(Description of how frontend components are organized, e.g., Atomic Design, Feature-sliced Design)

### 2.3. Data Flow
(Explanation of how data flows within the frontend and interacts with the backend APIs)

### 2.4. Routing
(Details on client-side routing and navigation)

## 3. Backend Architecture

### 3.1. Technology Stack
- Language: [e.g., Node.js, Python, Java, Go, C#]
- Framework: [e.g., Express, Django, Spring Boot, FastAPI, .NET]
- Database: [e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, Redis]
- ORM/ODM: [e.g., Sequelize, TypeORM, Mongoose, SQLAlchemy, Hibernate]
- API Style: [e.g., REST, GraphQL, gRPC]

### 3.2. Service Organization
(Description of how backend services are organized, e.g., Monolith, Microservices, Serverless Functions)

### 3.3. API Design
(Details on API endpoints, request/response formats, authentication, and authorization)

### 3.4. Data Storage & Management
(Details on database schema, data models, and caching strategies)

## 4. Infrastructure & Deployment

### 4.1. Cloud Provider
[e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean]

### 4.2. Compute Services
[e.g., EC2, Lambda, Kubernetes, App Engine, Azure App Service]

### 4.3. Database Services
[e.g., RDS, DynamoDB, MongoDB Atlas, Cloud SQL, Azure Cosmos DB]

### 4.4. CI/CD Pipeline
[e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, CircleCI]

### 4.5. Monitoring & Logging
[e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, CloudWatch, Stackdriver]

## 5. Security Considerations

(Outline of security measures at different layers: authentication, authorization, data encryption, input validation, etc.)

## 6. Scalability & Performance

(Strategies for ensuring the application can scale and perform under load)

## 7. Error Handling & Resilience

(Approach to error handling, fault tolerance, and system resilience)

## 8. Development Environment

(Details on setting up a local development environment, tools, and scripts)
